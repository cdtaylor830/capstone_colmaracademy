Codecademy Freelance Class Capstone Project 2

This project was completed for the Codecademy Freelance Web Development Course, Week 7.

Known issues/concerns:
  -Images in the information section, mobile version are distorted. I would love some advice on fixing how much they stretch until the browser shrinks down small enough.
  -I'm still getting a grasp on when to deploy flexboxes and when to position with other CSS tools, so some items/sections may grow/shrink in ways that could be improved.
  -The links in the header transition to background color and white text when hovered over. Currently, the two are separate transitions, and the white color only works when hovering directly over the link text, not the whole button.
  -Site switches to mobile version at 650px, which is a bit big I think, but currently necessary, as obvious breaks begin to occur around 620. I will consider adding a tablet version as a middle ground.
  -Accessibility can be improved with ARIA.
